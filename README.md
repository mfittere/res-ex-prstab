Source files for the PRSTAB paper on the effects of resonant excitation in the LHC
==================================================================================

The main LaTeX file is `resex.tex`.

`resex_SR2018-01-31_MF2018-02-06.pdf` contains comments and responses on the first
circulated draft.

To-do
-----

- [ ] revise format of bibliography

- [ ] add PACS numbers

- [ ] add keywords

- [ ] arrangement of figures

- [X] add acknowledgment to Sergei

- [ ] "probability A" on the vertical axis of beam distributions is confusing:
it is not a probability, and A already indicates excitation amplitudes.

- [ ] 7th turn pulsing, figure with comparison: no data for 2016 at 24 nrad or
for simulations. Useful to add?

- [ ] for random, verify the numbers for emittance growth (1%/min in simulations,
5%/min in experiments) and for simulated losses (0.1%/h).

- [ ] report number in Ph.D. thesis?

- [ ] reintroduce references on noise?

- [X] better reference (openly accessible) than Chamonix for LHC performance
in 2016 -> Jorg at IPAC17

- [ ] TM-2657 is not available online
