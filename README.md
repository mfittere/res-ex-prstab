Paper on the effects of resonant excitation in the LHC
======================================================

Manuscript for Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams.

Main files:

* the LaTeX file is `resex.tex`.

* `resex.bib` is the BibTeX bibliography.

`resex_SR2018-01-31_MF2018-02-06.pdf` contains comments and responses on the
first circulated draft.

`resex_2018-03-26_v2_circulated.pdf` is revised version 2, circulated to
co-authors.

To-do
-----

- [X] revise format of bibliography

- [X] add PhySH keywords

- [X] arrangement of figures

- [X] add acknowledgment to Sergei

- [ ] "probability A" on the vertical axis of beam distributions is confusing:
it is not a probability, and A already indicates excitation amplitudes.

- [ ] for random, verify the numbers for emittance growth (1%/min in simulations,
5%/min in experiments) and for simulated losses (0.1%/h).

- [X] report number in Ph.D. thesis? No.

- [X] reintroduce references on noise

- [X] better reference (openly accessible) than Chamonix for LHC performance
in 2016 -> Jorg at IPAC17

- [ ] TM-2657 is not available online
