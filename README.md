Source files for the PRSTAB paper on the effects of resonant excitation in the LHC
==================================================================================

The main LaTeX file is `resex.tex`.

`resex_SR2018-01-31_MF2018-02-06.pdf` contains comments and responses on the first
circulated draft.

To-do
-----

- [ ] revise format of bibliography

- [ ] add PACS numbers

- [ ] add keywords

- [ ] arrangement of figures

- [X] add acknowledgment to Sergei

- [ ] "probability A" on the vertical axis of beam distributions is confusing:
it is not a probability, and A already indicates excitation amplitudes.

- [ ] 7th turn pulsing, figure with comparison: no data for 2016 at 24 nrad or
for simulations. Useful to add?
