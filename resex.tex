\begin{abstract}
  In the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), a
  considerable amount of energy will be stored in the beam tails, due
  to the high beam intensity and to an overpopulation of the tails
  compared to a Gaussian distribution. To control and clean the beam
  halo, the installation of two hollow electron lenses (HEL), one per
  beam, is being considered. In standard electron-lens operation, a
  proton bunch sees the same electron current at every
  revolution. Pulsed operation (i.e., different current for different
  turns) is also considered, because it can widen the range of
  achievable halo removal rates. For an axially symmetric electron
  lens, only the halo particles are excited, leaving the core
  unperturbed. If a residual field is present at the location of the
  beam core, these particles are exposed to transverse kicks and to
  noise. In this paper, we present the results of numerical
  simulations and of the LHC experiments conducted in~2016 and~2017 to
  study the effects of random noise and of resonant excitations on the
  beam core. The excitation patterns were generated by the transverse
  damper system, which is a very flexible source of transverse dipole
  kicks. The main observables were losses, emittances, and transverse
  distributions as a function of excitation patterns and
  strengths. The resonant excitations showed rich nonlinear dynamics
  and nontrivial changes of the beam distribution, which, to our
  knowledge, have not previously been observed and studied in this
  detail. We also give estimates, based upon existing measurements of
  prototype electron guns, of the residual fields that may be expected
  in the HL-LHC hollow electron lens.

Considering past, current and future high energy colliders, each new
machine has represented a considerable leap in stored beam energy
(Table~\ref{tab:stored_energy}).

Furthermore, recent measurements at the LHC show that the tails of the
transverse beam distribution are overpopulated compared to a Gaussian
distribution. This results in a considerable amount of energy being
stored in the beam tails. In particular, in the case of the LHC, about
5\% of the beam population is stored in the tails (i.e., above
3.5$\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the Gaussian rms core beam size),
compared to 0.22\% in an ideal Gaussian distribution, leading to 19~MJ
of stored energy for nominal LHC parameters and 34~MJ in the case of
HL-LHC~\cite{helreview_valentino}. This leads to the conclusion that a
mechanism is needed to deplete the beam tails in a controlled
manner. Further information on the needs for halo control in LHC can
be found in Ref.~\cite{helreview}.

The most direct approach is to decrease the collimator gaps or to
periodically scrape the tails. However, this is not feasible, as it
would generate unacceptably large loss spikes and possibly component
damage. Most promising are methods which increase the diffusion speed
in the region of the halo particles, resulting in a smooth and
continuous removal of the high amplitude tails, while leaving the core
of the beam unperturbed. The diffusing halo particles are then
intercepted by the collimation system and removed. This concept is
also referred to as active halo control, designed to enhance a
conventional passive system, which is still needed to robustly
intercept the halo particles. An illustration of the concept is shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:active_halo_control}.

In a recent review, the need for such an active halo control system
for HL-LHC has been assessed, with the conclusion that it would
considerably increase the operational margins and reduce the risks for
machine protection~\cite{helreview}. In view of the need of active
halo control for HL-LHC and for future high power accelerators, like
HE-LHC and FCC-hh~\cite{helhcparam2011, fcc_coll_ipac2017}, different
active halo control methods have been
studied~\cite{helreview_bruce}. The hollow electron lens (HEL) is
considered the most established, flexible and suitable technology for
the HL-LHC~\cite{hel_tevatron_stancari, helreview}.

However, the beneficial effects of an HL-LHC HEL for machine
protection and for collimation cannot come at the expense of
performance degradation due to losses or emittance growth in the beam
core. In standard electron-lens operation, a proton bunch sees the
same electron current at every revolution. It is also possible to have
different currents for different groups of bunches. Under these
conditions, the imperfections of the hollow beam have a negligible
effect. On the other hand, in order to extend the range of achievable
removal rates, pulsed operation is also being considered. In this
case, different currents can be set to act on the same bunch at each
turn. If a residual field is present at the location of the beam core,
core particles can be exposed to resonant transverse kicks and to
noise.

In this paper, we concentrate on the experimental and numerical
assessment of possible detrimental effects on the beam core of a
pulsed electron lens. Section~\ref{sec:hel} gives an introduction to
the concept of HELs and summarizes the design parameters of the HL-LHC
HELs. Section~\ref{sec:core} is dedicated to the sources of residual
fields from the HEL in the core region. Section~\ref{sec:exp}
describes the setup of simulations and experimental
conditions. Results and comparisons between simulations and
measurements are given in Section~\ref{sec:simex}, with discussion and
summary in Section~\ref{sec:sum}. Auxiliary data and plots are
collected in the Appendices.

\subsection{General overview}
\label{sec:hel:intro}

Electron lenses are based upon continuous or pulsed low-energy,
magnetically confined electron beams~\cite{Shiltsev:PRSTAB:2008,
  Fischer:PRL:2015, Shiltsev:elens-book:2016}. The electron beam is
generated in an electron gun, guided and confined by strong solenoids
and finally dumped in a collector. As an example, the conceptual
design of the HL-LHC HEL is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hel_layout}.

The circulating beam (protons in the LHC case) is affected by the
electromagnetic field of the electron beam. For the application of
active halo control, the electron beam needs to generate an
electromagnetic field only at the location of the halo particles. This
field distribution can be achieved, for instance, by using a hollow
charge distribution in radius $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, uniformly
distributed between inner radius $R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:hel_field}). In this case, the circulating proton beam
experiences the following radial kick $\theta(r)$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:field_1}
  \theta(r)=\frac{f(r)}{(r/R_2)}\cdot \theta_{\rm max},
\end{equation}
%
where $f(r)$ is a shape function with
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:field_2}
  f(r) =
  \begin{cases}
    0 &,\quad r< R_1,\\
    \frac{r^2-R_1^2}{R_2^2-R_1^2} &,\quad R_1 \leq r < R_2,\\
    1 &,\quad R_2 \leq r
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
and $\theta_{\rm max}=\theta(R_2)$ is the maximum kick angle given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{hel_kick_max}
  \theta_{\rm max} = \theta(R_2) =
  \frac{2LI_T(1\pm\beta_e\beta_p)}{4\pi\epsilon_0  \cdot
    \left(p_0/q\right)_p \cdot \beta_e\beta_p
    c^2}\cdot\frac{1}{R_2},
\end{equation}
%
with $L$ the length of the HEL, $I_T$ the total electron beam current,
$\beta_{e}$ and $\beta_{p}$ the relativistic velocity parameters of
electrons and protons, $\left(p_0/q\right)_p = \left(B\rho\right)_p$
the magnetic rigidity for the proton beam reference particle, $c$ the
speed of light and $\epsilon_0$ the vacuum permittivity. The
$\pm$-sign in Eq.~\ref{hel_kick_max} represents the two cases of the
electron beam traveling in the direction of the proton beam
($v_e v_p>0$) leading to ``$-$" or in the opposite direction
($v_e v_p<0$) leading to ``$+$". For hollow electron beam collimation,
electrons and protons are chosen to counterrotate, so that the
magnetic and electric kicks add up. (For simplicity, the dependence of
the electron axial velocity on radius is neglected in
Eq.~\ref{hel_kick_max}.)

In the case of HL-LHC HEL design parameters
(Table~\ref{tab:hllhc_param} and Table~\ref{tab:hel_param}), the
maximum kick is:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:helkick}
  \theta_{\rm max,B1} = 392~\rm{nrad}
\end{equation}
%
for an inner radius of $R_1 = 4\sigma_p$, outer radius $R_2 =
7.5\sigma_p$, peak current of $I_e = \q{5.0}{A}$, using the Beam~1
lattice of the LHC. Similar values are obtained for Beam~2.


\subsection{Operation modes and effects on the beam core}
\label{sec:hel:core}

For the HEL, two modes of operation are currently under consideration:
the continuous mode (also referred to as `DC', or direct current, in
this paper) as standard operation mode, described above; and the
pulsed mode. The main benefit of pulsed HEL operation is the increase
in halo removal rates. A wider range of removal rates may become
important under operating conditions with small nonlinearities, in
particular low chromaticity and octupole current, when the DC mode may
be too slow~\cite{hel_halo_hllhc_fitterer, hl_halo_ipac2017}.

Two different pulsing patterns are considered for the HL-LHC. In both
cases, at each passage, a given bunch sees a different electron-lens
current and, therefore, experiences a different transverse kick. The
patterns are defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{random excitation:} The extraction voltage in the
  electron gun is modulated according to the
  following expression:
%
  \begin{equation}
    U_{\mathrm{e-gun}} = (1-a) \cdot U_{\mathrm{max}} +
    a \cdot \eta \cdot U_{\mathrm{max}},
  \end{equation}
%
  where $U_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum voltage, $a$ is the
  modulation strength, with $a \in [0,1]$, and $\eta$ is a uniformly
  distributed random number in the interval~$[0,1]$. Simulations and
  experiments, discussed below, were usually conducted with $a = 1$.

\item \textbf{resonant excitation:} The electron beam is switched on
  only every $k^{\mathrm{th}}$ turn. The excitation can be represented
  by the following expression:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \label{intro:eqn:1}
    f(t) & = & \sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}\delta\left[t-n\cdot(kT)\right],
  \end{eqnarray}
  where $n$ is the turn number and $T$ is the revolution period. Its
  Fourier representation is
  \begin{equation}
    \label{intro:eqn:2}
    f(t) = \Sh_{kT}(t) = \frac{1}{kT}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}e^{2\pi i f_nt},
  \end{equation}
  with $f_n = n \cdot f_{\rm rev} / k$ and
  where $\Sh_{kT}$ is the Dirac comb. In general,
  $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing drives $k^{\mathrm{th}}$-order
  resonances~\cite{md_sim_hel_res_ex_fitterer}. This type of pulsing
  pattern was used in the Tevatron during regular collider operations
  for abort-gap cleaning~\cite{hel_tevatron_abortgap_zhang}.
\end{itemize}

For an axially symmetric electron lens, the field at the beam core
vanishes. Effects on the proton core arise from imperfections, with
two main sources: the injection and extraction bends of the HEL
(discussed below in Section~\ref{core:sec:1}), where the electron beam
crosses the proton beam; and distortions of the electron beam profile
during its propagation under magnetic focusing and space charge
(Section~\ref{core:sec:2}). Both sources result in nonlinear
kicks~\cite{hel_bends_stancari,hel_model_polynomial_morozov}. In
continuous operation, these nonlinear kicks are usually much smaller
than the machine nonlinearities. Tolerances on imperfections are
therefore not particularly stringent. The picture changes
significantly in case of pulsed operation. If the electromagnetic
field does not vanish at the proton beam core, noise or resonant kicks
are transferred not only to the halo particles, as intended, but also
to the beam core. Tolerances on the residual fields in this case
become much more stringent. Studies of the effects of the HEL on the
beam core therefore focus on this mode of operation, which is also the
main subject of this paper.



\section{Sources of residual field in the proton beam core region and first order estimates\label{sec:core}}
With the current HEL layout as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hel_layout}, parasitic kicks on the proton beam core can arise in the central region due to profile imperfections in the electron beam and at the entrance and exit of the HEL, where electron and proton beam overlap. Currently, no HEL is installed in the LHC, and the kick on the proton beam core must therefore be emulated with the help of other devices already installed in the LHC. For this purpose the kick is approximated to first order by a dipole kick. During the experiments presented in this paper, the dipole kick with the corresponding excitation pattern could then be applied with the LHC transverse damper as will be described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:adt}. As will be shown in Sec.~\ref{core:sec:1} and \ref{core:sec:2}, the expected kick to first order from the HEL bends is estimated to be~(Eq.~\ref{eqn:kick_bends}):
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x'_{\rm{bends}},\Delta y'_{\rm{bends}}\approx \SI{0.5}{nrad},
\end{equation}
and for the central region due to profile imperfections~(Eq.~\ref{eqn:kick_central}):
\begin{equation}
	\Delta x'_{\rm{central \ region}}, \Delta y'_{\rm{central \ region}} \approx \SI{20}{nrad} % this should be rounded to the same number of digits as the 0.5nrad
\end{equation}
where the current HEL design parameters are used (see Table~\ref{tab:hllhc_param}--\ref{tab:hel_param}). The contribution from the central region is clearly dominating.

\subsection{Uncompensated kicks from HEL bends}
\label{core:sec:1}
As reference for the estimate of the dipole component originating from the HEL bends, the symplectic map derived in \cite{hel_bends_stancari} is used. In this case the HEL bends are modeled as a bent cylindrical pipe with a static charge distribution of 1~A and 5~keV electrons deflected in the horizontal plane, where the parameters were her still based on the old gun design for the Tevatron electron lens \textcolor{red}{Giulio, is this correct?}. In case of an U-shaped HEL, the transverse dipole kicks at entrance and exit add up, while for a S-shape the kicks compensate each other. For this reason a S-shape has been chosen for the HL-LHC HEL (see Fig.~\ref{fig:hel_layout}). Assuming and S-shaped HEL, uncompensated kicks therefore only arise from imperfections, which can originate from profile imperfections and current fluctuations. As a first estimate, we assume in this paper 10\% fluctuations between the entrance and exit and, in addition, that the kicks from entrance and exit due to these imperfections add up. Using the electric field calculations in \cite{hel_bends_stancari}, the maximum values for the integrated electric field are then
\begin{equation}
\int_{z_1}^{z_2} E_{x,y} dz= 10 \ \mathrm{kV}.
\end{equation}
%given an \SI{1}{A}, \SI{5}{keV} electron beam.
%For \SI{7}{TeV} protons and neglecting magnetic effects, this yields a kick of:
%\begin{equation}
%\Delta x'=\Delta y'= \SI{1.4}{nrad},
%\end{equation}
%Scaling to the HEL design parameters of a \SI{5}{A} and \SI{10}{keV} electron beam (Table~\ref{tab:hel_param}), one obtains:
%\begin{equation}
%\int_{z_1}^{z_2} E_{x} dz= 36 \ \mathrm{kV} \Rightarrow \Delta x'= \q{5.1}{nrad}
%\end{equation}
Neglecting magnetic effects and scaling to HL-LHC and HEL design parameters (Tables~\ref{tab:hllhc_param}--\ref{tab:hel_param}) yields a kick of \cite{md_sim_hel_res_ex_fitterer}:
\begin{equation}
\int_{z_1}^{z_2} E_{y} dz= 36 \ \mathrm{kV} \Rightarrow \Delta y'= \q{5.1}{nrad}
\end{equation}
Assuming now 10\% fluctuation between entrance and exit kick, the expected kick from the HEL bends is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kick_bends}
\Delta x', \Delta y'\approx \q{0.5}{nrad}.
\end{equation}

    electron-lens test stand combined with Warp calculations of the
    electric potentials and fields in a cylindrical beam pipe.}
\label{core:fig:1}
\end{figure*}

For a perfectly annular and axially symmetric profile, the field in
the region of the proton beam core vanishes. This is expressed by
Eq.~\ref{eq:field_2} and is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:hel_field}. Fields at the location of the proton beam
core can arise in case of profile imperfections of the electron
beam, in particular if the axial symmetry is broken.

Recently, a hollow electron gun prototype for the LHC (called CHG1b)
was characterized at the Fermilab electron lens test
stand~\cite{hel_test_stand_fnal}. An example of a measurement of the
electron beam current density is shown in Fig.~\ref{core:fig:0}.

In the test stand, only resistive solenoids are available. Through
simulations, one can estimate the fields generated by the compressed
electron beam profile needed for HL-LHC. The measured distribution is
compressed to the inner electron beam radius of 1.24~mm, corresponding
to $4\sigma_p$, as described in Table~\ref{tab:hllhc_param} and
Table~\ref{tab:hel_param}. A distribution with about $65\,000$
particles is generated according to the measured current-density
profile. As boundary condition, the LHC inner beam pipe radius
$b=30$~mm is used. The potential and fields are then calculated with
the particle-in-cell code Warp~\cite{warp}. The resulting relative
electric field strengths are shown in Fig.~\ref{core:fig:1}. The
electric field is obviously proportional to the charge density of
electrons. Its relative strength is rather insensitive to the hollow
beam radii, as long as these remain small compared to the beam pipe
radius. Further details on the measurements and Warp simulations can
be found in Ref.~\cite{hel_res_field_stancari_2017}.

Using these measurements and calculations of the relative electric
field strengths in the transverse plane (Fig.~\ref{core:fig:1}), we
obtain an average field in the hole of

\begin{equation}
  E_{\mathrm{rel}}= 5\%.
\end{equation}

For a maximum kick of 392~nrad, as derived in Eq.~\ref{eqn:helkick},
the estimated dipole kick amplitude at the proton beam core is then

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:kick_central}
  \Delta x'_{\rm{central \ region}}, \Delta y'_{\rm{central \ region}} = \SI{20}{nrad}.
\end{equation}

For the scope of this paper, only the approximate magnitude of the
residual dipole kick is considered. In general, the field map,
including its multipolar components, can be parameterized in a
symplectic form, as described for instance in
Ref.~\cite{hel_bends_stancari}, and used in tracking codes to estimate
the effects on the circulating beam.

\subsection{Overview of LHC experiments\label{sec:exp_sum}}
The experiments at the LHC which are presented in this paper were aiming at deriving tolerances on the residual HEL field at the location of the beam core in case of pulsed operation. In total, two experiments were conducted, the first one in 2016 \cite{resexmd2016} and the second one in 2017 \cite{resexmd2017}. Beam and machine parameters for both experiments are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:md_param}. Preceding the beam experiments, simulations were performed to identify the most effective $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing pattern and yield estimates for losses and emittance growth. The two $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing patterns with the largest effect, one $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing pattern with no effect and the random excitation could then be experimentally tested in the LHC. In order to test the reproducibility of the results at least on the example of one pulsing pattern, the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing was first tried in 2016 and then repeated in 2017.

During the experiments the losses were measured with the fast beam current transformers (FBCTs) and the emittance and transverse beam profiles with the beam synchrotron radiation telescope (BSRT), where all instruments are capable of delivering bunch-by-bunch data. The analysis of the BSRT profiles is quite involved and we will therefore focus in this paper only on the direct comparison of the profiles. A detailed description of the analysis with more details can be found in \cite{bsrtprofinj} and for the individual experiments in \cite{resexmd2016,resexmd2017}.

\subsection{Excitation with transverse damper and filling scheme\label{sec:adt}}
The primary function of the transverse feedback system in LHC, also referenced to as ADT, is to provide injection oscillation damping and actively damp the coupled bunch instabilities driven by the machine impedance. The main building blocks of the ADT system are stipline pickups at the position Q7 and Q9 at Point~4 of the LHC, connected to the beam position measurement modules at the surface, the digital signal processing modules (mDSPU) and a set of tetrode power amplifiers feeding electrostatic kickers in the RF zone of the LHC~\cite{adt_sum_2008,adt_sum_2011}. Though originally designed to damp the undesired transverse activities only, the damper is being routinely used for sophisticated beam excitations as well thanks to the state of the art digital signal processing hardware. These include among others abort and injection gap cleaning, single bunch excitation for tune and linear coupling measurements and special modes of operation for dedicated experiments at the LHC.

The transverse feedback is in general active during the whole LHC cycle, therefore it is critical that the noise introduced by the system does not contribute to any emittance growth. The typical machine cycle requires a short damping time of ~10-20 turns (high feedback gain) for injection oscillation damping, which is increased during the ramp and collisions to ~50-100 turns (lower feedback gain). It has been demonstrated that noise introduced by the transverse feedback system itself is sufficiently low not to introduce any measurable emittance growth \cite{adt_noise_emit_2017}. All excitation signals referenced to in this paper are digitally synthesized in the damper's digital signal processing units and therefore can be considered as ``noise-free''. This point is important as then the effect on the beam can be attributed entirely to the applied excitation and any effect due to unwanted residual noise can be neglected.

The resonant excitation experiment in 2017 involved simultaneous measurements on three groups of 72 bunches with a dedicated excitation pattern and transverse feedback configuration on each sub-group of 6 bunches. In 2016 a similar configuration was used, but with only 48 bunches in total and sub-groups of 4 bunches. Both schemes are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:fill}. In order to reduce the error of the measurements, the observables are averaged over each sub-group of bunches experiencing the same excitation amplitude, yielding in total 5~different amplitudes $n\Delta A$ with $n=1,\cdots, 5$ plus the references bunch without excitation for each transverse feedback configuration and excitation plane. Furthermore, the experiments were usually split in 3 different parts:
\begin{description}
	\item[Part 1] No excitation is applied in order to allow the distribution to reach an equilibrium state after injection.
	\item[Part 2] The excitation is applied with a first maximum excitation amplitude of $A_{\mathrm{max,1}}=5\Delta A_1$.
	\item[Part 3] The maximum excitation amplitude is further increased to $A_{\mathrm{max,1}} < A_{\mathrm{max,2}}=5\Delta A_2$.
\end{description}
Each part lasted approximately 10-15~minutes, which is considered to be a long enough time window to allow the beam distribution to reach its new equilibrium state. In the plots of the experimental results shown later in the paper, the maximum excitation amplitude is indicated with black horizontal arrows, while the average of each sub-group of bunches with the same excitation amplitude $n\Delta A$ is distinguished with different colors.

The excitation in the horizontal and the vertical plane is generated by a different set of signal processing hardware, however during this experiment the signals were synchronized at a turn level. This means the bunches of the third group (of 72 bunches) experienced the kick in both horizontal and vertical plane during the same turn.

The ADT kicker deflection angle is calculated from the kicker geometry and the excitation voltage on the deflection plates. The excitation voltage used in the experiments is a complicated waveform, generated by a very complex hardware (digital signal processor, chain of transmission lines, low and high power amplifiers). The peak excitation voltage (and subsequently the kick) seen by the beam can be only indirectly measured using the probes on each kicker. The measured values are therefore believed to be known with an error margin of 10-15\% for the experiments in 2017 and 50\% in 2016. The estimate for 2017 is based on only a single measurement and in the future and with more time available the determination of the error would definitely have to be improved. The error in 2016 is estimated from the transverse damper operational parameters. Due to lack of the dedicated machine time no precision calibration was performed. The maximum kick strength reachable with the ADT at injection without risking saturation is 96~nrad. As an example Fig.~\ref{fig:fill_meas} shows the oscillation amplitude of each bunch in both H and V planes captured by the LHC real time transverse activity monitor during the 2017 experiments and an excitation with $8^{\mathrm{th}}$ turn pulsing. The measured activity is well in line with the expected excitation pattern.

\subsection{Overview of simulations\label{sec:sim}}
For the preparation and interpretation of the experiments two different types of simulations were performed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item tracking of a Gaussian distribution, referred to as ``distribution tracking" in this paper, to obtain loss rates and emittance growth,
	\item Frequency map analysis (FMA) for the visualization of resonances~\cite{fmalaskar}.
\end{enumerate}
For both simulation types, the tracking code Lifetrac \cite{lifetrac} was used. The simulation parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:sim_param}. Further details on the simulations are given in Refs.~\cite{md_sim_hel_res_ex_fitterer,resexmd2017}.

\section{Experimental and simulation results\label{sec:simex}}
In the following we will jump forth and back between both experimental and simulation results as the experimental results are best understood on the base of the simulations. In summary, the most efficient pulsing patterns could be successfully predicted in simulations, which we will demonstrate on the example of the 2016 experiments (see Sec.~\ref{sec:pattern}). Afterwards we will present the simulation and experimental results of the tested excitation patterns, explicitly the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn, $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn and $8^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing in Secs.~\ref{sec:simex10}--\ref{sec:simex8} as well as the random excitation in Sec.~\ref{sec:simexran}. As a last chapter, Sec.~\ref{sec:damp}, we will address the influence of the transverse damper in the presence of an external excitation source on emittance, losses and beam distribution.

Quantitative predictions of loss rates and emittance growth proved in general challenging as both observables are influenced in addition by the natural noise present in the LHC, originating for example from vibrations and magnetic field ripple. The observed effect is then the result of the interaction of the external excitation with the natural noise. At injection, this natural noise component is not known and thus presents a very influential but undefined input to the simulations. Beside the natural noise, also collective effects like intra-beam scattering and electron cloud influence the time evolution of emittance and losses. Both are also not taken into account in these simulations, but the effect was minimized during the experiments by choosing an as small as possible bunch intensity of only $0.7\times10^{11}$ protons per bunch.

\subsection{Dependence on the pulsing pattern\label{sec:pattern}}
The effect of each pulsing pattern in comparison to the other patterns can be identified by the means of the loss rate and emittance growth from the distribution tracking. As an example, the simulation results for the 2016 experiment are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:patternsim} featuring a clear dependence of both parameters on the pattern.

The resonant and random excitation respectively is applied in both planes with an amplitude of 96~nrad. No random noise component is added in addition.}
\end{figure*}

The largest losses are observed for $3^{\mathrm{rd}}$, $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing and a uniform random excitation. As the bunch length decreases in accordance with the losses, the losses can be mostly associated to off-momentum particles hitting the transverse aperture. Only $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing as well as random excitation exhibit considerable emittance growth. Compared to any resonant excitation, the random excitation has by far the strongest effect.

The sensitivity to $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing is also observed in absence of machine errors in which case the only source of non-linearities are sextupoles and octupoles~\cite{md_sim_hel_res_ex_fitterer} suggesting that latter are responsible for the observed sensitivity. The driven resonances are revealed by the FMA analysis shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:patternfma}. The $7Q_x$ resonance is excited in case of the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing and the $10Q_x$ and $10Q_y$ resonance in case of the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing. As octupoles can only drive even resonances, the source of the $7Q_x$ resonances are the sextupoles while the octupoles only generate the tune footprint. The other pulsing patterns do not exhibit any increase in losses or emittance growth without magnetic errors and their effect can be thus attributed to the magnetic field errors, implying also the seed chosen for the simulation.

The excitation is 120~nrad in the corresponding plane. The absence of a strong excitation of any resonance in case of $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing only in V and the strong excitation in case of pulsing only in H confirms the excitation of the $7Q_x$ resonance. For $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing there is in contrast no significant difference between pulsing only in H, only in V or in H+V (see Appendix~\ref{app:sec:10}, Fig.~\ref{app:fig:fma:10}).}
\end{figure*}  

One may have noticed that the emittance in case of the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing starts at an increased initial value and then stays almost constant during the entire simulation time, which usually points to an error in the chosen simulation setup. This behavior is however typical for any resonant excitation and can be ascribed to the adjustment of the beam distribution during the first $10^4$ turns to a new equilibrium. As the beam distribution is only dumped every $10^4$ turns, this initial fast adjustment manifests itself in an increased initial emittance value in Fig.~\ref{fig:patternsim}, and also any other simulations over $10^6$ turns presented in this paper. Besides an increased emittance, the new distribution also becomes non-Gaussian. This is illustrated by means of the residual in respect to the Gaussian distribution for $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing in Fig.~\ref{fig:patternhist}. This initial fast change of the beam distribution is not an artifact of the simulation, but has been, to the knowledge of the authors, also for the first time experimentally observed during the 2016 and 2017 LHC experiments presented in this paper. The timescale of this fast adjustment is in experiments however much slower than predicted in simulations --- on the timescale of minutes compared to seconds.

The excitation is applied in both planes with an amplitude of 96~nrad. The residual is defined as the final distribution (here after $10^4$~turns) minus the initial distribution (here after $10^2$~turns) as \%, and the ratio as the final distribution divided by the initial distribution. The red line in the plot of the residual is the difference between the Gaussian fit of the distribution and the distribution itself.}
\end{figure*}

In the presence of only a resonant excitation, this modified distribution is stable in simulations with a constant emittance. As we will see later, an increase of the emittance with the applied excitation amplitude is however observed experimentally not matching the prediction by simulations. By adding a random noise component representative for the natural noise present in the LHC, the constant emittance is changed in simulations to an excitation amplitude dependent emittance growth after an initial adjustment phase. In case of random uniform noise, the excitation leads to constant emittance growth without any initial adjustment phase. The interaction with the natural noise source then only results in an underestimation of loss rates and emittance growth as it is basically equivalent to the application of random noise with an increased amplitude. In addition to the experiments presented in this paper, the effect of a random excitation was also studied in a separate experiment at the LHC for the case of colliding beams \cite{md1433_noise_top_energy,md_noise_bbLHC}.

\subsection{$10^{\mathrm{th}}$ turn pulsing\label{sec:simex10}}
The $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing pattern was tested in 2016 with an excitation in the vertical plane only. As this was the first time a resonant excitation was tested in the LHC, only in total 48~bunches could be injected in order to still guarantee the protection of the machine. To test different excitation amplitudes during one fill and have enough statistics, the excitation was therefore only applied in one plane. As described earlier, the experiment started with a period of 12~minutes without excitation in order to let the beam distribution fully adjust to its equilibrium state after injection. Afterwards the excitation was applied with the excitation scheme shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fill} and a maximum excitation amplitude of $A_{\mathrm{max}}=5\Delta A = 48~$nrad for a total of 11~minutes. The excitation was then further increased to the maximum value reachable without saturation of $A_{\mathrm{max}}=5\Delta A = 96~$nrad and kept for 11~minutes. In both cases, the excitation induced the following changes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Increase of the loss rate with the excitation amplitude (Figs.~\ref{fig:10thexp}.
	\item Increase of the emittance growth with the excitation amplitude in the vertical plane but not in the horizontal plane (Fig.~\ref{fig:10thexp}).
	\item Change of the beam distribution for the excited bunches (Fig.~\ref{fig:10thexpprof}).	
\end{enumerate}
As loss rates, emittance growth and beam distribution stayed unchanged for the $4$~reference bunches, the above observations can be also truly associated with the effect of the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing.

\end{figure*}
These experimentally obtained scalings of the loss rate and emittance growth with the excitation amplitude can be then used for the actual specification of the hollow electron lens.

Besides the numerical determination of tolerances, the vertical emittance actually features indeed the strange and interesting behavior predicted in simulations: a fast adjustment phase of the beam distribution visible as a rapid increase of the emittance followed by the reach of a new equilibrium distribution apparent by a slower continuous emittance growth. These two phases are indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:10thexp} in blue and black.

Thanks to the good performance of the Beam Synchrotron Radiation Telescope (BSRT)~\cite{bsrtprofinj}, the distribution changes indirectly observed as changes of the emittance could also be for the first time directly measured. As example Fig.~\ref{fig:10thexpprof} shows the vertical profile of a reference bunch and one bunch experiencing the maximum excitation of $5\cdot\Delta A=A_{\mathrm{max}}=48$~nrad and afterwards 96~nrad. The distribution of the excited bunch not only changes but becomes clearly non-Gaussian, while the reference bunch stays unchanged.

\end{figure*}
The simulation results from the distribution tracking for $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing and without (solid line) and with (dotted line) additional random noise component to emulate the natural noise present in the LHC are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:10thsim}. As no estimate of the natural noise is available at injection for the LHC, a first estimate is obtained by scaling the estimate for 6.5~TeV \cite{md1433_noise_top_energy,md_noise_bbLHC} by the magnetic rigidity to the injection energy of 450~GeV. This yields a maximum kick amplitude at the transverse damper of approximately
\begin{equation}
\theta_{\mathrm{random,ADT,max}}(\mathrm{450~GeV}) = 6~\mathrm{nrad}.
\end{equation}
As can be seen from simulations, adding a random noise component not only yields the correct qualitative behavior of the emittance but also increases the losses. As the losses are in general underestimated in simulations compared to the experimental results, the discrepancy between simulations and experiment can be thus reduced.  To better compare the experimental results for the two different maximum excitation amplitudes applied for slightly different time intervals and also the simulations conducted for a much shorter interval of only 90~s, we define the relative loss rate $R$:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lossrate}
R = \frac{I_{\mathrm{start}}-I_{\mathrm{end}}}{I_{\mathrm{start}}\cdot \Delta t}
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the intensity and $\Delta t$ the time interval during which the excitation with fixed $A_{\mathrm{max}}$ is applied during the experiments or the duration of the simulation respectively. A qualitative comparison of the loss rates obtained in experiments and simulations is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:10thexploss} featuring a surprisingly good agreement. It should be also kept in mind that the additional random noise component considerably influences the simulation results and as long as it is unknown should be seen more as a fit parameter than a real experimentally confirmed input parameter. The measured loss rates for $A_{\mathrm{max}}=48$~nrad and $A_{\mathrm{max}}=96$~nrad should furthermore follow the same scaling. Instead the loss rates for the same excitation amplitude are smaller for $A_{\mathrm{max}}=96$~nrad compared to $A_{\mathrm{max}}=48$~nrad. That losses and also emittance growth for a fixed excitation amplitude do not exactly agree for both experiments, is a general tendency observed in all experiments. As the second excitation however starts from an already by the previous excitation changed beam distribution, the difference is however not surprising and can be explained by this difference in initial conditions. For checking the reproducibility of the results in a possible future experiment, it would be interesting to see if the same loss rates are measured if for each $A_{\mathrm{max}}$ a new fill is used.

\subsection{$7^{\mathrm{th}}$ turn pulsing\label{sec:simex7}}
The $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing pattern has been tested during both experiments in 2016 and 2017. In 2016 the resonant excitation was tested for the first time in the LHC and the experiments were therefore still in the exploratory state. Based on the experience gained in 2016, the experiments could then be repeated more systematically with more bunches allowing to also test in addition the dependence on the excitation plane. Also in case of the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing, the experiment in 2016 as well as in 2017 can be divided in different parts: the first part without excitation, the second part with a resonant excitation with a maximum amplitude of $A_{\mathrm{max}}=6$~nrad, a third part in which the excitation amplitude is further increased to $A_{\mathrm{max}}=12$~nrad and in case of the 2016 experiments even further to $A_{\mathrm{max}}=24$~nrad. As the machine tune was changed in standard operation from (64.28,59.31) in 2016 to (62.27,60.295) in 2017 accompanied by a slight change in optics, considered irrelevant in the context of the presented measurements, a direct comparison of the two experiments and thus check of reproducibility is however not possible. 

The described change in tune entailed a change in the driving resonances, from previously the $7Q_x$ resonances in 2016 to mainly the $7Q_x$ and $7Q_y$ resonance in 2017. This can be seen from the FMA analysis for the 2016 optics (see Fig.~\ref{fig:patternfma} bottom left and bottom right), which shows a strong increase in diffusion for $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing in H around the $7Q_x$ resonances and only small changes for pulsing in V. In case of the 2017 optics and tune, the $7Q_x$ as well as the $7Q_y$ resonances cross the tune footprint (see Fig.~\ref{fig:7th2017fma} top left) and are also excited by the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing visible as an increase of the diffusion in tune around the corresponding resonance lines for pulsing only in H or only in V and thus also for H+V (see Fig.~\ref{fig:7th2017fma}). An increase in the diffusion in tune however much weaker than for the $7Q_x$ and $7Q_y$ resonances is also observed around the $7Q_x + 7Q_y$ resonances for pulsing in V and H+V suggesting also an excitation of this $14^{\mathrm{th}}$ order resonance in addition. Why it is not visible for pulsing only in H is not understood.

\end{figure*}

The simulation results from the distribution tracking shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:7thsim} in general predict in terms of emittance for the two experiments:
\begin{description}
	\item[2016 experiment] Excitation amplitude dependent emittance growth in the horizontal but not in the vertical plane.
	\item[2017 experiment] Excitation amplitude dependent emittance growth in the vertical plane but not in the horizontal plane for an excitation in V and H+V. For an excitation only in H no emittance growth is observed.
\end{description}
Similar changes of the emittance as predicted in simulations were also experimentally observed as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:7thexp}, where emittance growth was observed only in the horizontal plane for pulsing in H in 2016, and only in the vertical plane for pulsing in V and H+V in 2017 with no emittance growth at all for pulsing in H. Just as for the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing, the emittance growth can be divided also for the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing in a phase of fast adjustment of the beam distribution and the reach of a new equilibrium state indicated in blue (fast adjustment) and black (equilibrium state) in Fig.~\ref{fig:7thexp}. Also in this case, the distribution changes are directly visible on the beam profiles taken with the BSRT (see Appendix~\ref{app:sec:7}, Fig.~\ref{fig:7thexpprof}).

\end{figure*}

The losses measured during the experiment however differ from the simulations in terms of for which case the largest rate is observed as well as quantitatively for the specific cases. For example smaller losses are expected for the 2016 experiments compared to the 2017 experiments from simulations, while experimentally higher loss rates were measured in 2016 (see Fig.~\ref{fig:7thexploss}). For the 2017 experiment, the highest loss rates are expected for pulsing in H+V, than in H and then with a considerably reduction in V. During the experiment comparable loss rates are however measured for all three planes (see Appendix~\ref{app:sec:7}, Fig.~\ref{fig:7thexploss2017}). Last but not least the loss rates as defined in Eqn.~\ref{eqn:lossrate} for the 2016 (red and yellow) and 2017 (black and gree) experiments are compared in Fig.~\ref{fig:7thexploss}. In both cases and as also observed for the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing, the loss rate follows a quadratic scaling with the excitation amplitude. Loss rates were in general higher during the 2016 experiments. The loss rates from simulations are not shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:7thexploss} as losses were only observed for much higher excitation amplitudes than tried in the experiments.

\subsection{$8^{\mathrm{th}}$ turn pulsing\label{sec:simex8}}
Pulsing patterns which have little effect on the beam core are particularly interesting for the hollow electron lens operation if they in addition have a large effect on the halo. This is in general feasible considering the highly nonlinear field generated at the location of the halo particles by the HEL compared to no field or only a very small field at the location of the beam core. With this motivation in mind the $8^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing pattern was studied, for which a small effect in comparison to the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\mathrm{th}}$ turn pulsing is expected (see Fig.~\ref{fig:8thsim}).

The excitation is 96~nrad in both planes. The $16Q_y$ and \mbox{$8Q_x-4Q_y$} are both excited.}
\end{figure*}
In simulations no visible effect is indeed observed for excitation amplitudes smaller than 96~nrad. In the horizontal and vertical plane a small emittance growth due to the excitation is visible, but without any clear dependence on the amplitude or plane. The FMA analysis in amplitude space reveals also the driven resonances (Fig.~\ref{fig:8th2017fmaamp}), which are the $16Q_y$ and \mbox{$8Q_x-4Q_y$} resonances and several even higher orders. These are in general very high order resonances whose effect is thus expected to be small.

\end{figure}
The small effect on the beam expected from simulations could then be also confirmed experimentally during the 2017 experiment. For this purpose the excitation amplitude was increased to the maximum reachable amplitude of 96~nrad. As depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:8thexploss}, the loss rate increased slightly with the excitation amplitude for an excitation in H+V. For an excitation only in V or only in H, no statistically relevant increase was observed (see Appendix~\ref{app:sec:8}, Fig.~\ref{fig:8thexploss2017}). In the horizontal plane, a change in beam distribution was measured with the BSRT profiles (Appendix~\ref{app:sec:8}, Fig.~\ref{fig:8thexpprof}) for an excitation only in~H. The distribution increased around $2.0~\sigma$ simultaneously with a depletion of the beam core. For an excitation in H+V one would expect to see a similar distribution change. However, this change is not visible as the emittance of the references bunches was much smaller, around $1.8~\mu$m normalized emittance, compared to around $2.6~\mu$m for the excited bunches \cite{resexmd2017}. This difference in emittance then resulted in a stronger emittance growth due to intra-beam scattering for the reference bunches in comparison to the excited bunches making the additional emittance growth and distribution changes due to the excitation undetectable. In the vertical plane, the beam distribution and emittance were not affected by the resonant excitation.

\subsection{random excitation\label{sec:simexran}}
The random excitation presents in general the pulsing pattern leading to the fastest halo depletion rates achievable with an HEL. On the other hand this pattern is also the most dangerous one for the proton beam core. The aim of this experiment was to test the effect on the core in comparison to the resonant excitation represented in the 2017 experiment by primarily the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing as for $8^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing basically no effect was observed. The random excitation is in general so powerful as it excites all frequencies of the beam equally.

This can be seen clearly on the example of the FMA analysis in amplitude space depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:ran2017fmaamp}. In the case of a random excitation, the diffusion in tune is increased in comparison to the $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing rather equally for all particle amplitudes.

The distribution tracking shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ransim} also reveals a quite symmetric evolution of the beam parameters for a random excitation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Emittance growth is only caused by an excitation in the same plane.
	\item The emittance growth is quantitatively comparable for an excitation in only the corresponding plane. Only a small increase or decrease is observed if the excitation is applied in both planes. The difference could be due to coupling.
	\item The random excitation leads to an increase of the emittance growth rate. Compared to the $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing there is explicitly no initial adjustment phase of the distribution.
	\item Negligible losses are observed independent of the plane of excitation.

\end{figure*}

Qualitatively, this behavior could be also confirmed experimentally during the 2017 experiments. Here excitation amplitude dependent emittance growth was only recorded in the plane of excitation with all excitation amplitude dependent emittance growth rates in a comparable range. As example the relative horizontal and vertical emittance for pulsing in V and in H+V are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:ranexp}. Note that as expected from simulations and despite the large excitation amplitude dependent emittance growth, the growth rates stays constant. There is explicitly no fast adjustment phase succeeded by a new equilibrium state as observed for the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing.

The changes in emittance are also directly visible in the beam profiles measured with the BSRT. As an example Fig.~\ref{fig:ranexpprof} shows the profile for a random excitation only in V in comparison to a reference bunch. The distribution also stays Gaussian in case of a random excitation in contrast to the $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing in which case it clearly assumes a non-Gaussian shape (see Fig.~\ref{fig:10thexpprof}).

\end{figure*}
The experimental results for a maximum excitation amplitude of $A_{\mathrm{max}}=1$~nrad and $A_{\mathrm{max}}=6$~nrad also confirm the in general small losses predicted in simulations. The losses then increase more dramatically around the time when the maximum excitation amplitude is increased to $A_{\mathrm{max}}=12$~nrad (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ranexpprof}). This is most likely the point when, due to the large emittance growth, the physical aperture starts cutting into the more central region of the distribution. Furthermore, the dependence of the loss rate on the excitation plane is additive, meaning that double the loss rate is observed for an excitation in H+V compared to only in H or only V. The loss rate is also considerably reduced for the bunches with transverse damper active independent of the plane the excitation is applied in (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ranexplossplane}). In comparison to the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing, the loss rate for a random excitation is smaller for a maximum excitation amplitude of $A_{\mathrm{max}}=6$~nrad, but larger for $A_{\mathrm{max}}=12$~nrad (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ranexploss}). This indicates an increase of the diffusion mostly in the beam tails for $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing, while for a random excitation mostly the core is affected.

\end{figure*}
For all $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing patterns tested experimentally, the transverse damper does in general not change any of the observables studied during the experiments, explicitly losses, emittance and beam distribution suggesting that indeed it is not damping any resonant excitation. On the other hand, the transverse damper considerably decreases any changes of the above parameters in case of a random excitation. As an example, the vertical emittance growth for the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing in V is compared with a random excitation in V in Fig.~\ref{fig:damp}. The same observation is also made in case of losses as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ranexploss} comparing the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing in H+V with a random excitation in H+V. For the $7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing the two curves for the transverse damper active and not active almost coincide while for the random excitation a significant difference is visible. Until present, it is unknown why the transverse damper (ADT) appears to be incapable of damping any resonant excitation as it fulfills all requirements to detect as well as damp the caused oscillation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The closed orbit distortion caused by the resonant excitation during the experiments is large enough to be detectable with the ADT pickups.
	\item The ADT compares the position of each bunch with its position in the previous turn in order to detect an orbit distortion to be damped. Therefore an oscillation due to any $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing with $k>1$ would be noticed and damped.
	\item The ADT is capable of damping the oscillation of each bunch individually. The ADT should therefore be capable of applying the correct corrective kick for each group of bunches seeing the same excitation amplitude.
\end{itemize}
Further studies are therefore needed in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the interaction of the transverse damper with a resonant excitation.

\section{Summary\label{sec:sum}}
This paper intends to give an overview of the effects of the hollow electron lens (HEL) on the proton beam core and the experiments conducted in this context at the LHC in 2016~\cite{resexmd2016} and 2017~\cite{resexmd2017}. For a perfect HEL without any imperfections no effect on the core is to be expected as the field at the center vanishes by construction. Only in the case of imperfections in the guidance and profile of the electron beam, a residual kick on the proton beam core can occur. In this case and assuming HL-LHC parameters (Tables~\ref{tab:hllhc_param}--\ref{tab:hel_param}), the contribution from the electron lens bends with approximately $0.5$~nrad to first order is negligible with respect to the kick expected from the central region of the HEL of approximatley $20$~nrad to first order caused by profile imperfections in the electron beam. In DC operation these kicks, even if nonlinear in reality, are negligible compared to the nonlinearities present in the LHC and HL-LHC and are thus of no concern. The picture changes if the HEL is operated in pulsed mode, in which case noise is introduced on the halo particles (intended) as well as on the beam core (unintended) in the presence of imperfections of the HEL entailing much more stringent tolerances.

To study the effect on the beam core in case of the much more dangerous pulsed operation, beam experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017 at injection. As no hollow electron lens is currently installed in the LHC, the in reality non-linear kick was emulated to first order by a dipole kick with the corresponding excitation pattern. The experimental results in general suggest that for the kick amplitudes as expected from the HEL, considerable effects are to be expected for a random excitation and certain resonant excitations, explicitly $7^{\mathrm{th}}$ and $10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing during the conducted experiments. In addition, also one resonant excitation pattern, the $8^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing, was tested featuring a small effect on the beam core. Assuming that this pattern has a large effect on the beam halo, it would be an optimal candidate for a feasible HEL excitation pattern.

The resonant excitation in general features a rich nonlinear dynamics leading to a diversity in beam distribution and diffusion changes as can be seen for example from the very diverse effects of the different $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing patterns observed in simulations and experiments. The origin of this diversity is due to the fact that only certain frequencies and thus resonances are excited. Typical for the resonant excitation is also the fast adjustment of the beam distribution to a new equilibrium state which could be for the first time measured in the experiments and predicted in the simulations presented in this paper. The random excitation on the other hand excites all beam frequencies equally, leading to the highest increase in halo removal rates for the HEL \cite{hel_halo_hllhc_fitterer} but also the strongest effects on the core, mainly in terms of strong emittance growth as predicted in simulations, experiments and also a multitude of earlier publications on the subject of random noise. From the experiments the tolerances summarized in Table~\ref{tab:tolexp} could be obtained, where for each excitation pattern and plane the smallest kick amplitude is listed for which an increase in emittance or losses was observed.
\begin{table}
	\caption{\label{tab:tolexp}%
		Minimum kick amplitudes $\Delta z'$ for which either an increase in emittance or losses was observed during the LHC experiments. The tolerances are given for the case of the transverse damper not active. The same tolerances are obtained for the case with the damper active in case of all resonant excitation. In case of a random excitation the tolerance can be increased by roughly a factor~2.
	}
	\begin{ruledtabular}
		\begin{tabular}{lccc}
		pulsing pattern & exp. year & plane & $\Delta z' \ [\mathrm{nrad}]$  \\
			\colrule
			random & 2017 & H or V & 2.4 \\
			 & & H+V & 1.2 \\\hline
			$7^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn & 2016 & H & 2.4 \\
			 & 2017 & H & 2.4 \\
			 & 2017 & V & 1.2 \\
			 & 2017 & H+V & 1.2 \\\hline
			$8^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn & 2017 & H & 14.4 \\
			& 2017 & V & $>96$ \\
			& 2017 & H+V & 12 \\\hline
			$10^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn & 2016 & V & 9.6 \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}
Tolerances in case of a random excitation are extremely stringent. For a resonant excitation the effect depends strongly on the order $k$ of the $k^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing. For a future HEL, the pattern could therefore be tuned to the machine and beam configuration in order to yield a strong effect on the halo particles and small effect on the beam core. Compared to the estimated kick amplitude of the HEL on the beam core of
\begin{equation}
\Delta x', \Delta y' = 20 \ \mathrm{nrad}
\end{equation}
the tolerances for all experimentally tried pulsing pattern except for $8^{\mathrm{th}}$~turn pulsing in V lie below this value. As a next step, the experiment should be conducted at collision energy where the HEL is most needed. At collision energy the inherent noise level of the LHC is smaller which could lead to more relaxed tolerances than the ones obtained at injection energy.
